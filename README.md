# Exceptions Handling in Java

## What are exceptions?
> An **exception** is any condition that interrupts the normal flow of a program. When an exception occurs, the program terminates unexpectedly and does not continue further unless the exception is handled.

<hr>

## When Can Exceptions Occur?
-   **Compile-time** (Checked Exceptions)
-   **Runtime** (Unchecked Exceptions)

**Examples of Situations that Cause Exceptions:**
-   Dividing a number by zero
-   Accessing an invalid index in an array
-   Trying to open a file that doesn't exist

<hr>

## Types of Exceptions in Java
Java exceptions are divided into **three main categories**:

| Type                 | Description                                                                                       | Examples                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Checked Exception**| Checked at **compile-time**. Must be either handled using try-catch or declared using `throws`. | `ClassNotFoundException`, `IOException`         |
| **Unchecked Exception**| Occurs at **runtime**. Not checked by the compiler.                                               | `ArithmeticException`, `NullPointerException`   |
| **Errors**           | Serious problems that are usually **not handled** by programs.                                    | `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`        |

<hr>

## What is `throw`?
‚úÖ **Use:**
`throw` is used **to actually throw an exception yourself** in the code.

üîß **Why? (Use cases)**
Sometimes you want to **force an error when something goes wrong**, e.g., if input is invalid.

üìå **Example:**

> **Explanation:** Here, if age is negative, we **throw** an exception immediately to stop execution and inform the caller about the problem.

<hr>

## What is `throws`?
‚úÖ **Use:**
`throws` is used in the **method declaration** to say: "‚ö†Ô∏è This method **might throw this type of exception**, so whoever calls it should handle it."

üîß **Why? (Use cases)**
To **inform the compiler and programmer** that this method could throw an exception, and it is **not handling it inside itself**.

üìå **Example:**

> **Explanation:** This says "I am not handling `IOException` inside this method, so whoever calls `readFile()` must handle or declare it."

<hr>

## What is `finally`?
‚úÖ **Use:**
`finally` is a block that **always runs** after `try` (whether an exception happens or not).

üîß **Why?**
To **clean up resources** like closing files, releasing database connections, etc.

üìå **Example:**

> **Explanation:** No matter if an exception is thrown or not, the **`finally` block runs**.

| Keyword   | Use                                           | Meaning                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `throw`   | Actually **throws an exception**              | "I am throwing an error now."                         |
| `throws`  | **Declares** that a method can throw an exception | "This method might throw this error, caller handle it." |
| `finally` | Always runs after try-catch                   | "For Cleanup! Code here always runs."                 |

<hr>

## What are Custom Exceptions?
**Explanation:**
-   Java has built-in exceptions like `ArithmeticException`, `IOException`, etc.
-   Sometimes, you want to create your **own exception class with meaningful names** to handle specific situations in your program.

‚úÖ **How?**
-   Create a class extending `Exception` (checked) or `RuntimeException` (unchecked).


> **Explanation:**
> 1.  `InvalidAgeException` is a **custom exception class**.
> 2.  The `setAge` method **throws** it if the number is negative.
> 3.  `main` catches and handles it.

<hr>

## What are Multiple Catch Blocks?
**Explanation:**
-   You can have **multiple `catch` blocks** to handle **different types of exceptions** separately.
-   The first matching `catch` block executes.

**Program: Multiple Catch Blocks**
> **Explanation:**
> 1.  **First error:** `name.length()` causes `NullPointerException`.
> 2.  The **first exception is caught** and handled here, so division by zero does not occur because the line below the error does not execute.

<hr>

## Why is Exception Handling Important?
1.  **Prevents program from crashing suddenly**
    > Without handling, if an error occurs, the program **stops immediately**.
2.  **Helps identify and handle errors gracefully**
    > You can **show meaningful messages to the user** instead of confusing errors.
3.  **Allows the program to continue or shut down properly**
    > You can decide whether to **continue execution or exit safely**, releasing resources.
4.  **Helps in debugging**
    > You know **where and why** an error happened.

> **Real-life example:** Imagine an ATM machine code. If it crashes due to a small input error without handling, the machine will stop working for everyone. Exception handling ensures a **smooth user experience even in errors**.

<hr>

## `try-catch-finally` Explained
-   **`try` block:** Contains **code that might cause an exception**.
-   **`catch` block:** Contains **code to handle that exception** if it occurs.
-   **`finally` block:** Contains **code that always runs**, whether an exception occurs or not (e.g., closing files).

**Example Program:**


<hr>

## Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions

### 1. Checked Exceptions
> **Definition:** Exceptions that are **checked at compile time**.
-   ‚úîÔ∏è The compiler **requires you to handle them**, either with `try-catch` or by declaring with `throws`.
-   üî∑ **Examples:** `IOException`, `SQLException`, `FileNotFoundException`.
-   üìå **Why?** Because they are **expected to happen** during normal program execution (e.g., file not found, network issues) and you should **prepare for them**.

### 2. Unchecked Exceptions
> **Definition:** Exceptions that are **not checked at compile time**.
-   ‚úîÔ∏è The compiler **does NOT force you to handle them.**
-   üî∑ **Examples:** `ArithmeticException`, `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
-   üìå **Why?** These are mostly **programming errors** or **logic mistakes** that can be prevented by writing correct code.

| Feature         | Checked Exception                             | Unchecked Exception                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **When checked?** | At **compile time**                           | At **runtime** only                       |
| **Handling?**   | **Yes**, must handle or declare with `throws` | **No**, not mandatory                     |
| **Examples**    | `IOException`, `SQLException`                 | `ArithmeticException`, `NullPointerException` |
| **Type**        | Subclass of `Exception`                       | Subclass of `RuntimeException`            |

<hr>

## `throw` vs `throws`

| Feature              | `throw`                                          | `throws`                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**          | **Actually throws an exception**                 | **Declares that a method might throw an exception**    |
| **Usage**            | Inside a method or block                         | In the method signature                                |
| **Number of exceptions** | Can **throw only one exception at a time**     | Can **indicate multiple exceptions**, separated by commas |
| **Example**          | `throw new ArithmeticException("Invalid");`     | `public void f() throws IOException, SQLException;`  |

<hr>

## What `throws` Actually Does
> In Java, the `throws` keyword is used in a **method signature** to indicate that the method **might cause** one or more exceptions. It doesn't throw anything itself ‚Äî it just **signals** that the method doesn't handle those exceptions internally.

**Example:**

> This tells the compiler and the caller: **"I'm not catching this exception here ‚Äî you need to handle it."** The caller must then handle it gracefully using `try-catch`.

# Multithreading

## What is Multithreading?
> ‚úÖ **Definition:** Multithreading is a **feature that allows multiple parts of a program (threads) to run at the same time** to perform tasks concurrently.

‚úîÔ∏è **Why use it?**
-   To **make programs faster** (e.g., downloading files while updating UI).
-   To **perform multiple tasks simultaneously** (e.g., audio + video playing together).

> üî∑ **Real-life example:** Using your phone while downloading apps in the background ‚Äî **both tasks run together without waiting for each other to finish**.

<hr>

## How is Multithreading implemented in Java?
There are **two main ways**:

### 1. Extending the `Thread` class
üìå **Steps:**
1.  Create a class that **extends `Thread`**.
2.  Override the **`run()` method** with the code you want to execute in the thread.
3.  Create an object of your class and call **`start()`** to begin the thread.

**Example:**


### 2. Implementing the `Runnable` interface
üìå **Steps:**
1.  Create a class that **implements `Runnable`**.
2.  Override the **`run()` method**.
3.  Create a `Thread` object, passing your class object to its constructor, and call **`start()`**.

üîß **Example:**


<hr>

## What is synchronization in multi-threading in java ?
> ‚úÖ **Definition:** Synchronization is a **mechanism to control access to shared resources by multiple threads** to prevent **data inconsistency**.

üîß **Why is it needed?**
> When two or more threads access **the same data at the same time**, they might **change its value unexpectedly**, leading to **wrong results (race condition).**

> üéØ **Real-life example:** Imagine **two people withdrawing money from the same bank account at the same time**. Both might see the same balance and withdraw, leading to a negative or incorrect final balance. Synchronization ensures only one person (thread) can access the account at a time.

<hr>

## How to implement synchronization in Java?
üìå **Using the `synchronized` keyword:**
1.  **`synchronized` method:** Only one thread can execute the method on an object at a time.

**Example:**


<hr>

## What is Inter-Thread Communication?
> ‚úÖ **Definition:** Inter-thread communication allows **threads to communicate with each other** (cooperation), rather than working independently.

**Why?**
> To **avoid busy waiting** (when a thread keeps checking a condition repeatedly, wasting CPU). It enables threads to **wait** for each other and **notify** when ready.

> **Example: Producer-Consumer problem**
> -   **Producer:** Produces items and adds them to a queue.
> -   **Consumer:** Consumes items from the queue.
> -   If the queue is full, the producer waits. If it's empty, the consumer waits. They **communicate using `wait()` and `notify()`**.

<hr>

## Java Methods for Inter-thread Communication
-   `wait()`: Makes the thread **wait (pause) and release its lock**, until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()`.
-   `notify()`: **Wakes up one waiting thread**.
-   `notifyAll()`: **Wakes up all waiting threads**.

| Concept                       | Meaning                                     | Why?                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Synchronization**           | Controlling thread access to shared resources | To **avoid data inconsistency**             |
| **Inter-thread communication**| Threads communicate via `wait()`/`notify()` | To **coordinate work between threads efficiently** |

# Inheritance

## What is Inheritance?
> ‚úÖ **Definition:** Inheritance is a feature of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** where a **new class (child/subclass)** can **acquire properties and methods** of an **existing class (parent/superclass)**.

### üéØ Why is inheritance useful?
‚úîÔ∏è **Code Reusability:** No need to write the same code again.
‚úîÔ∏è **Improves Readability:** Clear relationship between classes.
‚úîÔ∏è **Supports Hierarchical Classification:** Like a real-world family tree.

> **‚úÖ Real-life example:**
> -   **`Animal` (superclass)** ‚Üí has basic features like `eat()`, `sleep()`.
> -   **`Dog` (subclass)** ‚Üí inherits `eat()`, `sleep()` from `Animal`, and adds its own `bark()`.

### üåü Features of Inheritance
-   üî∑ **1. Reusability:** Reuse existing code from the parent class.
-   üî∑ **2. Extensibility:** Extend features of the parent by adding new features in the child.
-   üî∑ **3. Data Hiding:** Child class can't directly access `private` data of the parent.
-   üî∑ **4. Overriding:** Child class can override parent methods to provide a specific implementation.
-   üî∑ **5. Hierarchical classification:** One parent can have multiple child classes.

> **üåü How is Inheritance implemented in Java?**
> ‚úÖ **Using the `extends` keyword.**

**Example Program**


| Type         | Supported in Java?                         | Example      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Single**   | ‚úÖ Yes                                     | A ‚Üí B        |
| **Multilevel**| ‚úÖ Yes                                     | A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C    |
| **Hierarchical**| ‚úÖ Yes                                     | A ‚Üí B, A ‚Üí C |
| **Multiple** | ‚ùå No (directly, but via interfaces)       | A, B ‚Üí C     |
| **Hybrid**   | ‚ùå No (directly)                           | Combination  |

<hr>

## Extends keyword
‚úÖ **What is it?**
-   The `extends` keyword is used to **create a subclass from a superclass**.
-   It establishes an **inheritance** relationship between two classes.

üîß **Where is it used?**
In the **class declaration line**:```java
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
// ...
}


<hr>

## super keyword
### What is it?
-   `super` refers to the **parent class (superclass) object**.
-   It is used to:
    -   **a) Access parent class variables and methods.**
    -   **b) Call the parent class constructor.**

### a) Accessing parent method or variable

> **Explanation:**
> -   `super.sound();` calls the **parent class's method**.
> -   `sound();` calls the **current class's method**.

### b) Calling parent class constructor

> ‚úîÔ∏è **Explanation:**
> -   `super();` calls the `Animal`'s constructor before executing the `Dog`'s constructor body.

| Keyword   | Purpose                                               | Usage                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **extends** | To **inherit** from a parent class                    | `class B extends A { }`           |
| **super**   | To **refer to the parent class's members** or constructor | `super.methodName();` or `super();` |

<hr>

## Types of Inheritance

### 1. Single Inheritance
‚úîÔ∏è **One child inherits from one parent.**


### 2. Multilevel Inheritance
‚úîÔ∏è **A chain of inheritance.** (A class extends a child class).

> **Explanation:** `Dog` inherits from `Animal`, and `Puppy` inherits from `Dog`.

### 3. Hierarchical Inheritance
**‚úîÔ∏è One parent, multiple children.**


***

# Polymorphism

## What is Polymorphism?
> ‚úÖ **Definition:** Polymorphism is an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept** where the **same function or object behaves differently** in different situations.
> **Meaning:** "**One name, many forms.**"

> **üéØ Real-life example:**
> -   A person acts as a **student in class**, a **child at home**, and a **friend outside**.
> -   **Same person, different behaviors** based on the context.

<hr>

## Types of Polymorphism in Java
-   ‚úÖ **1. Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)**
-   ‚úÖ **2. Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding)**

### 1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
> üî∑ **What is it?** When **multiple methods have the same name but different parameters** (different type or number of arguments).
> ‚úîÔ∏è The correct method to call is **decided during compile time**.

**Example:**

> **Explanation:** The same method name `add` is used with **different parameters**.

### 2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
> üî∑ **What is it?** When a **child class provides its own implementation** of a method that is already defined in its parent class.
> ‚úîÔ∏è The correct method to call is **decided during runtime**.

**Example:**


| Type of Polymorphism | How achieved?           | When decided?   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| **Compile-time**     | **Method Overloading**  | **Compile time**|
| **Runtime**          | **Method Overriding**   | **Runtime**     |

***

# Abstraction
> The concept of **hiding complex implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** of an object is called abstraction.

## What is an Interface in Java?
> ‚úÖ **Definition:** An interface in Java is like a **blueprint of a class**. It contains **abstract methods** (method declarations without a body).

**Purpose:**
-   ‚úîÔ∏è To achieve **abstraction**.
-   ‚úîÔ∏è To achieve **multiple inheritance** (since Java doesn't support it with classes).
-   ‚úîÔ∏è To define **what a class must do**, not how it must do it.

<hr>

## Difference between Class and Interface

| Feature            | Class                                            | Interface                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Keyword used**   | `class`                                          | `interface`                                      |
| **Members**        | Can have variables, constructors, concrete methods | Can have abstract methods (without body)         |
| **Implementation** | Defines **how** things work (implementation)     | Defines **what** to do (specification)         |
| **Inheritance**    | Can `extend` only one class                       | Can `implement` multiple interfaces                |
| **Instantiation**  | Can create objects                               | **Cannot** create objects directly             |
| **Constructor**    | Has constructors                                 | Has **no** constructor                         |

> **Memory Tip:**
> ‚úîÔ∏è **Class = implementation (how)**
> ‚úîÔ∏è **Interface = specification (what)**

<hr>

## How are abstract classes different from regular classes?

| Feature         | Abstract Class                             | Regular Class                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Instantiation** | **Cannot** be instantiated                 | Can be instantiated           |
| **Abstract methods**| Can have abstract methods                  | **Cannot** have abstract methods |
| **Purpose**     | To provide a partial implementation base     | To provide a full implementation |
| **Keyword**     | Declared with the `abstract` keyword       | No special keyword needed     |

<hr>

## Difference between Abstract Class and Interface

| Feature        | Abstract Class                               | Interface                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Methods**      | Can have **abstract and concrete methods**   | All methods are **abstract by default** (pre-Java 8) |
| **Variables**    | Can have **instance variables**              | Can only have `public static final` constants    |
| **Inheritance**  | A class can `extend` only one abstract class | A class can `implement` many interfaces          |
| **Constructors** | Can have constructors                        | **No constructors**                              |
| **Use-case**     | When classes share common behavior         | To define a pure **abstraction contract**        |

> **Memory Tip:**
> ‚úîÔ∏è **Abstract class = partial abstraction + implementation**
> ‚úîÔ∏è **Interface = full abstraction (contract only)**

<hr>

## Why is Multiple Inheritance not supported directly in Java?
> ‚úÖ **Multiple inheritance:** When a class **inherits from more than one parent class**.

**The Diamond Problem:**
> It creates **ambiguity** if two parent classes have methods with the same signature. If `Class C` inherits from `Class A` and `Class B`, and both have a `show()` method, which one should `C.show()` call?

**Java's Solution: Interfaces**
-   ‚úîÔ∏è Java **achieves multiple inheritance using interfaces** because interfaces only have method declarations (no implementation, pre-Java 8).
-   ‚úîÔ∏è The implementing class provides its **own implementation**, so there is **no ambiguity**.

<hr>

## How to Implement Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces?
‚úÖ **Steps:**
1.  Define **two or more interfaces**.
2.  Implement them in a **single class**, separated by commas.

**Example Program:**


<hr>

## Example of abstract class

> **Explanation:**
> -   The class `Animal` is declared using the `abstract` keyword.
> -   It has both a concrete method (`eat`) and an abstract method (`sound`).
> -   `Dog` extends `Animal`, so it **must** provide an implementation for the `sound` method.

# File handling

## What is File Handling?
> ‚úÖ **Definition:** File handling is the process of **creating, reading, writing, and modifying files** using a program.

üî∑ **Why is it useful?**
-   ‚úîÔ∏è To **store data permanently**.
-   ‚úîÔ∏è To **read or write files** for data processing, reports, logs, etc.

### üéØ Real-life examples of file handling:
-   Saving user data to a `.txt` file.
-   Reading configuration files for app settings.
-   Writing logs of transactions in banking systems.

## How is File Handling done in Java?
Java provides the **`java.io` package** for file handling.

### ‚úÖ Basic File Handling Operations
1.  **Creating a File**
2.  **Writing to a File**
3.  **Reading from a File**
4.  **Deleting a File**

<hr>

## Example Programs
**Before you start:**
1.  Import necessary classes like `java.io.File`, `java.io.IOException`, etc. (or just `java.io.*`).
2.  Wrap file operations in a `try-catch` block to handle `IOException`.

### Creating a new file

> **Explanation:**
> -   The `File` class is used to represent a file path.
> -   `createNewFile()` creates the file if it does not exist and returns `true`. If it exists, it does nothing and returns `false`.

### Writing to a file

> **Explanation:**
> -   `FileWriter` is used to write character streams to a file.
> -   The `write()` method writes the given text to the file.
> -   Always call `close()` to save the changes and release resources.

### Reading from a File

> **Explanation:**
> -   The `Scanner` class can be used to read from a file line by line.

### Delete a file

> **Explanation:**
> -   The `delete()` method deletes the file and returns `true` if successful.

| Operation | Class/Method Used       |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| **Create**  | `File` + `createNewFile()` |
| **Write**   | `FileWriter` + `write()`   |
| **Read**    | `Scanner` + `nextLine()`   |
| **Delete**  | `File` + `delete()`        |
